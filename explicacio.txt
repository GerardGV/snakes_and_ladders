1. PART:
When we start to code we have difficulties in read and understand the structure of 
the program, but once we have taken it our, we understand how to work and implement the
changes in creating the new class that mix two.

2.PART:
This part was quite complex, in fact we had the challenge on chase/find those functions 
and atributes which would had been modified in order to implement the new class 'death'.
For example, if we wanted to implement it, one of the functions that was compulsory to change
was the constructor in charge of the board creation that received one more vector which contained 
the squares where we desire to mark as death. Moreover, was primordial to select wisely where 
to implement new logical structures for the flux control game, where as well as all players 
were dead the game should finish.
